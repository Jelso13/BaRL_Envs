# BaRL_Envs
A collection of Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments which I have implemented as part of my research. Hopefully this collection will grow over time, and prove useful to others as well.

All of these environments use an interaction API similar to that used by [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), however we do not implement Gym's `Environment` class directly.

Further documentation coming soon!
