# barl_envs

A collection of Reinforcement Learning Environments developed by the Barth Reinforcement Learning (BaRL) lab.

All of these environments use an interaction API similar to that used by [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), however we do not implement Gym's `Environment` class directly.
